  Will use strengths listed to seek alternate methods for solutions, and keep trying to find solutions even if it becomes hard to 

## In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Q’s Response 
    More of the technical aspect and will definitely need some guidance with coding aspect of the project 
- Sunny’s Response 
    I want to develop a more in depth understanding to technical processes  


## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?


- Q’s response
    Will have initial meetup before working on assigned tasks to make sure there are no blockers and will carry out tasks and will obtain assistance if required
    Will also try to work in remo class room together so communication is always available if required
- Sunny’s Response 
    Look at the Trello project board, and then determine the goals for the given day before diving into the code 
    Discuss potential problem areas as well as potential success areas 


# Conflict Resolution

- Q’s Response 
    Will have discussion of noticeable difference in task management and will discuss ways to find solutions

    We will have discussions and constant check ins to ensure the assigned workload is being done 
    What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Q’s Response
    Will discuss with individual to make sure that load is shared equally 
- Sunny’s Response 
    Discussions are key to ensure that each person is taking on the assigned task that will be at least close to equal workload 
     If there is more work needing to be done on one side, both team members can concentrate in that area  


## How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Q’s Response 
  Will discuss before the beginning of the project to better grasp where an individual's knowledge is currently and will make adjustments if necessary.
  Will also know that instructors and TA’s are available if required for extra assistance. 

- Sunny’s Response 
  The approach would be to have check in points to discuss problem areas, to focus on that area to gain mutual understanding
